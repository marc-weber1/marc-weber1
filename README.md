## Intro



Hi! I'm a coder of 8 years and a contractor since 2017, and while professionally I'm usually a backend and cloud developer my skills are extremely varied. Most of my work is under NDA, but feel free to look below for a bit of what I've done outside of work, but most of these will probably be unfinished since I'm typically busy with school or work contracts.

## Audio Plugins / Graphics

https://github.com/marc-weber1/juce-opengl-example - OpenGL component system for JUCE

https://github.com/marc-weber1/FacadeSaturator - Originally meant to waveshape sound with a bezier curve (i.e. simple sample-in sample-out function), but mostly just an oscilloscope for the moment

https://github.com/marc-weber1/skybox-painter - Very simple substance painter-like demo for painting on cubemaps in openGL

I have other audio projects as well that aren't released on github - if you are interested in seeing the code let me know.
